Tailwind CSS Best Practices

Project Configuration

Configure theme extension for consistent brand colors and spacing
Set up proper content paths in tailwind.config.js for purging
Define custom utility classes for repeated patterns
Configure dark mode support for future flexibility


Component Styling

Use utility classes directly over custom CSS whenever possible
Group related utilities with @apply only for frequently repeated patterns
Extract component-specific styles to dedicated component libraries
Keep component styles consistent with design system


Responsive Design

Follow mobile-first approach in all component designs
Use consistent breakpoint naming across components
Utilize Flexbox and Grid utilities effectively for layouts
Implement proper spacing system using Tailwind's spacing scale


Component Library Integration

Use shadcn/ui components as a foundation for UI elements
Maintain consistent component API for all custom components
Create a component showcase/storybook for documentation
Ensure proper accessibility through ARIA attributes and semantic HTML


Performance Optimization

Properly configure content paths for production builds
Use appropriate code splitting for component-heavy pages
Minimize custom CSS outside of Tailwind's utility system
Implement Just-in-Time mode for development efficiency
